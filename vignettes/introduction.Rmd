# Introduction

The ufcscrapeR package provides a straightforward way to scrape UFC and Pride fight data directly from UFCStats.com. With ufcscrapeR, you can quickly access round-by-round statistics, total fight metrics, control times, strikes by location, takedown data, submission attempts, and more. These rich datasets can fuel predictive modeling, data visualization, and advanced MMA analytics.

This vignette introduces the main functionalities of ufcscrapeR and demonstrates how to use the package to pull data for a given fighter, export results to a CSV, and perform a brief exploratory analysis.

## Key Features at a Glance

- **Scrape UFC and Pride Data:** Retrieve data for any fighter who has participated in UFC or Pride events.
- **Granular Metrics:** Extract round-by-round and total fight-level statistics, including strikes (head, body, leg), takedowns, submission attempts, and control times.
- **Easy Integration:** The output is structured as a data frame, making it easy to integrate with packages like `dplyr`, `ggplot2`, and `tidymodels`.

## Getting Started

Before you begin, ensure you have the package installed and loaded:

```{r load-package}
# If not installed from source:
# install.packages("devtools")
# devtools::install_local("path_to_ufcscrapeR")

library(ufcscrapeR)
```

## Retrieving Data

The main function you’ll use is get_ufc_data(). Simply supply a fighter’s name, and ufcscrapeR will fetch their fight history and statistics.

```{r get-data, eval=FALSE}
# This code is wrapped in eval=FALSE to prevent long runtime or network dependencies during CRAN checks.
# Remove eval=FALSE to run locally.
df <- get_ufc_data("Israel Adesanya")
head(df)
```

What You’ll See:

The returned data frame includes key fight-level details (opponent, event, result, method, etc.) and multiple columns detailing strikes, takedowns, and other stats both at the total fight level and on a round-by-round basis.

## Data Structure and Columns

The returned data frame may contain:

- **Basic Info:** fighter_name, opponent_name, event_name, event_date, round, Time, method_main (e.g., KO/TKO, SUB, DEC), method_detail (e.g., Punches, Rear Naked Choke).
- **Total Metrics:** Columns prefixed with TOT_ represent aggregated fight-level stats, such as TOT_fighter_SigStr, TOT_opponent_Td, TOT_fighter_SubAtt, and more.
- **Round-by-Round Data:** Columns like Round1_fighter_SigStr, Round1_opponent_Ctrl detail stats specific to each round.

## Exporting Data to CSV

You can easily save the scraped data to a CSV file using export_ufc_data_csv():

```{r export-example, eval=FALSE}
export_ufc_data_csv(df, "Israel_Adesanya_Fight_Data.csv")
```

This allows you to store your data locally for archival, sharing, or offline analysis.

## Example Analysis

Once you have the data in a data frame, you can leverage the broader R ecosystem to analyze and visualize it. For example, suppose we want to look at how a fighter’s significant strikes evolve over their career.

(Note: This code assumes df is loaded with data. You can remove eval=FALSE when you have a real dataset.)

```{r analysis-plot, eval=FALSE}
# Suppose df is already retrieved for "Israel Adesanya"
# Filter for fights with valid round data and plot total significant strikes by event date
df_clean <- df %>%
  mutate(event_date = as.Date(event_date)) %>%
  filter(!is.na(TOT_fighter_SigStr))

ggplot(df_clean, aes(x = event_date, y = TOT_fighter_SigStr)) +
  geom_line() +
  geom_point() +
  labs(
    title = "Trend in Fighter's Total Significant Strikes Over Time",
    x = "Event Date",
    y = "Total Significant Strikes"
  ) +
  theme_minimal()
```

- **Interpretation:** This plot would show how the fighter’s total significant strikes in a fight have changed over their UFC career, potentially indicating improvements or shifts in fighting style.

## Other Use Cases

- **Predictive Modeling:** Input metrics like average strikes per round, takedown defense rates, and submission attempts into a machine learning model to predict future outcomes.
- **Comparative Analysis:** Compare different fighters’ performance over time, or break down performance by weight class.
- **Advanced Analytics:** Combine with shiny to build an interactive dashboard for browsing fighters’ stats, or use tidymodels for creating predictive models.

## Tips & Best Practices

- **Be Specific with Fighter Names:** If a name is common, try full names or a well-known identifier to ensure correct matching.
- **Check Data Quality:** Older fights, especially from Pride, may have less detailed stats. Always inspect your data for completeness.
- **Keep Data Updated:** UFCStats.com updates after each event, so rerun get_ufc_data() periodically to have current data.
- **Integration with Ecosystem:** Combine ufcscrapeR output with tools like dplyr for data wrangling, ggplot2 for visualization, and caret or tidymodels for modeling.

## Getting Help and Contributing

- **Issues & Feature Requests:** Report bugs or request features on the GitHub repository.
- **Community:** MMA analytics communities, Slack channels, or forums are great places to discuss insights and approaches.
- **Contributions:** Contributions are welcome—whether it's bug fixes, new features, or improved documentation. Please see CONTRIBUTING.md for guidelines.

## Conclusion

The ufcscrapeR package streamlines the process of obtaining UFC and Pride fight data, providing a wealth of information at your fingertips. Whether you’re a researcher, data scientist, or MMA enthusiast, this package can help you transform raw fight data into actionable insights.
